Multi-project simplifies the switching between different projects by
providing support for creating, deleting, and searching between projects.
Multi-project supports interactively finding a file within a project or
automatically switching the TAGS file for symbol lookup.

To use multi-project just add the following lines within your
.emacs file:

```elisp
(require 'multi-project)
(global-multi-project-mode)
```
